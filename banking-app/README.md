### New contents in Java

**Records:** is a special type of class declaration aimed at reducing the boilerplate code. 
Java records were introduced with the intention to be used as a fast way to create data carrier classes, 
i.e. the classes whose objective is to simply contain data and carry it between modules, 
also known as POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
